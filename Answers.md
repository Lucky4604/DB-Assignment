1) Relationship between “Product” and 
 “Product_Category” entities:

 The relationship between the “Product” and “Product_Category” entities is a one-to-many relationship. This means that one product category can have multiple products associated with it, but each product can belong to only one category. This relationship is established through the category_id foreign key in the product table, which references the id primary key in the product_category table.



2) Ensuring each product has a valid category:

 To ensure that each product in the “Product” table has a valid category assigned to it, you could use foreign key constraints. By defining the category_id in the product table as a foreign key that references the id of the product_category table, the database system will automatically ensure that any value entered into the category_id column of the product table corresponds to an existing id in the product_category table. If a product is inserted with a category_id that doesn’t exist in the product_category table, or if a category is deleted that still has products associated with it, the database system will return an error.
